== Description

+loofah-activerecord+ extends +loofah+'s HTML sanitization into Rails
ActiveRecord models.

See more about +loofah+ at: http://github.com/flavorjones/loofah

== Features

There are two ActiveRecord extensions included with loofah-activerecord:

* Loofah::ActiveRecordExtension is an *opt-in* sanitizer. You must explicitly declare attributes to be sanitized.
* Loofah::XssFoliate, a drop-in replacement for XssTerminate[http://github.com/look/xss_terminate/tree/master], is an *opt-out* sanitizer. By default all models and attributes are sanitized.

=== ActiveRecord Extension \#1: Opt-In

See Loofah::ActiveRecordExtension for full documentation. The class
methods mixed into ActiveRecord are:

* +html_document+
* +html_fragment+

which are used to declare how specific string and text attributes
should be scrubbed during +before_validation+.

  # app/model/post.rb
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    html_fragment :body, :scrub => :prune  # scrubs `body` using the :prune scrubber
  end

=== ActiveRecord Extension \#2: Opt-Out

See Loofah::XssFoliate::ClassMethods for more documentation. The class
methods mixed into ActiveRecord are:

* +xss_foliate+
* +xss_foliated?+

which are used to declare how specific string and text attributes
should be scrubbed during +before_validation+.

Attributes are scrubbed with the +:strip+ scrubber by default, unless
another scrubber is specified or the attribute is present in an
+:except+ clause.
